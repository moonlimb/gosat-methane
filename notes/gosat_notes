Notes
- GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite 'IBUKI' was launched in January 2009
- satellite data gives column mixing ratio measurements

Data 
=====

I focus on level 4 data produts, L4A and L4B which are both in Net CDF formats.

L4A (2009 - 2013)
====
L4A global methane flux is methane flux per each of 43 global regions (monthlyaverage)
Unit is 43 regions across the globa, 1 degree mesh (annual).
